            &nbsp; With their latest mission complete, it's time once again for
            the group to go back to mediocre missions. After all are done,
            Konohamaru and his friends pay a visit to Naruto. All which result
            in being chased by Sakura. Everyone is soon over though, as two
            mysterious ninja block their way, and one of them isn't too happy
            with Konohamaru. Sasuke arrives to save the day, but the leader of
            the group shows up, with stealth skills that surprise even Sasuke.
            Meanwhile, the Third Hokage announces that it's time once again for
            the Chuunin selection exams.
